# Forward-Looking Ideas from 2025-04-16

1. **Add Real API Support for More Services**
   - Integrate Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Grok/Groq, and other LLM APIs.
   - Add config fields for API keys and endpoints.
   - Implement model selection and error handling for each service.

2. **Agentic Stopping Mechanism**
   - Allow agents to signal when to stop via a special output field or token (e.g., `"stop": true`).
   - Consider heuristic or hybrid stopping strategies (e.g., stop on only positive feedback or after user confirmation).

3. **Max Rounds in Automatic Mode**
   - Implemented user-configurable max rounds to limit automatic cycles.
   - Future: Combine with agentic stopping for flexible loop control.

4. **Extensible Model/Service Selection**
   - Per-agent dropdowns for selecting backend service and model.
   - Placeholder logic for unimplemented APIs; easy to expand in the future.

5. **Deployment Options**
   - Consider porting to Flask for PythonAnywhere compatibility if public web access is needed.
   - Alternatively, deploy Streamlit app to Streamlit Community Cloud, Heroku, or similar.

6. **Enhanced Logging and Replay**
   - Maintain detailed logs of all exchanges for replay, analysis, or export.
   - Consider exporting sessions in various formats (JSON, XML, plaintext).

7. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - More detailed session summaries and navigation.
   - Multi-session support, export, or analytics features.
