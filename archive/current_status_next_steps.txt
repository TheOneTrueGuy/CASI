# Current Status & Next Steps (as of 2025-04-16)

## Summary of Today's Work

- **Anthropic Claude Integration:**
  - Added Anthropic Claude as a selectable backend in the app's UI.
  - Updated the configuration system to support Anthropic API keys and model selection via environment variables and config defaults.
  - Extended the backend logic to route requests to Anthropic using the official SDK, with robust error handling and retry logic.
  - Updated the UI and event handlers to allow users to select Anthropic as a backend and specify the Claude model.
  - Ensured all changes are compatible with the existing virtual environment and dependency management practices.
  - Installed and verified the `anthropic` package in the project's venv.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the `.env` file if not already present.
   - Test the app by selecting Anthropic as the backend and running both manual and automatic modes.
   - Verify that responses are generated correctly and that errors (e.g., missing API key, invalid model) are handled gracefully.

2. **Multi-API Expansion:**
   - Begin integration of Google Gemini API (next in alphabetical order), following the same pattern as Anthropic.
   - Prepare for Grok and Groq integration.

3. **Refactor & Clean Up:**
   - Refactor any duplicated logic in the backend selection and model routing.
   - Ensure all API integrations are modular and easy to maintain.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update the README and in-app documentation to reflect new backend/API options and usage instructions.

## Ending Synopsis & Future Directions

Once the current round of API integrations (Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, Groq) is complete and tested, the project will support seamless switching between multiple LLM providers. This will provide a robust foundation for:

- Advanced agentic features (e.g., agentic stopping, multi-agent orchestration)
- Enhanced logging, analytics, and prompt engineering tools
- UI/UX improvements for greater user control and transparency
- Expansion to additional LLM APIs or local model providers as they become available

**Depending on progress, the next major direction could be either deeper agentic automation and evaluation, or scaling the platform to support even more LLMs and collaborative workflows.**
